Home page: http://gintas.pov.lt/guitest


About
-----

guitest is a helper library for unit-testing GUI applications written
in Python.


License
-------

guitest is available on the MIT License, see the file LICENSE for
the complete text.


Getting the latest version
--------------------------

To get the latest development version you will need to install darcs,
David's Revision Control System (http://abridgegame.org/darcs/).  Then
you can retrieve the tree by executing the following command:

  darcs get http://gintas.pov.lt/darcs/guitest

(Note that you may easily send your patches to me by using `darcs record`
to create and store modifications and then `darcs send` to send them
by e-mail.)


Installation
------------

Invoke `python setup.py install` to install the library into the local
python's site-packages directory.  Alternatively you may simply copy the
guitest subdirectory to your project's main source directory.


Usage
-----

See python scripts in the examples subdirectory.  There is no real
documentation yet, you may want to look into the EuroPython 2005 presentation
in OpenOffice.org Impress format (ep2005.sxi) which has a broad overview.
Doctests (see guitest/tests/*.py), although verbose, may be useful as
they are always up to date.
